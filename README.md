# Yello,

 the yellow trello clone

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:8090> in your browser.


##Purpose:

     To build on my knowledge of the flux architecture and make an app that I might regularly use.

##Technologies:

    React, Alt, Webpack, React-DnD

##Difficulties:

    The greatest struggle I had with this project was that once I decided I wanted to add something it took me a long time before I attempted to do it. I would research and google and look up tutorials before I ever wrote a line a code. Call it procrastination, fear, or even call incompetance - it did not feel good.
    Also choosing to assign IDs upon creation of both cards and lists caused a lot of headaches when trying to make sure all the logic lined up between the nested components. I might have decided to scrap storing all the data in state but for whatever reason I thought that that would be counter-productive.

    Finally getting the drag and drop feature implemented at all took me around the internet and back. By the end of it, I barely remember the trip.

##Reflections:

    I think I could have made this project way easier on myself if I just decided to make a change of plans but for whatever reason I drew a line in the sand and wanted to see it through until the end. It's not like I haven't given up on a project before, hell I have a half-dozen failed Swift projects burning space on my iPhone.

    I guess I resent that it was so hard and yet I'm not satified with the result.

##Conclusion:

    I'm not happy with Yello. I took me to a lot of dark places. Hell even getting the webpack config right made me want to give up on this whole web developer thing. But when all is said and done, I made an app that runs.
